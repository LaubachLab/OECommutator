# OECommutator
3D print design for a part used with a commutator for neural recordings

This item can be used below a commercially available commutator, such as those from Adafruit, to help with rotations of recording harnesses in recordings in freely moving animals. This specific design fits the Adafruit Slip Ring with Flange - 22mm diameter, 12 wires, max 240V @ 2A (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1196). 

For application with the OpenEphys system (also compatible with the Intan systems), we used the RHD SPI Cable Adapter Boards (Part #C3430) available from Intan (https://intantech.com/RHD_SPI_cables.html?tabSelect=RHDSPIadapter&yPos=0). Be sure to follow the Application Note from Intan to be sure the Intan headstage is properly powered and grounded (https://intantech.com/files/Intan_RHD2000_commutator.pdf). ((from SRW's experience, if you do it wrong the headstage gets HOT and noisy, so DEFINITELY reference the Intan notes)). 

We used superglue to hold down the board to the top of the arm, and to seal the wires in place on the underside and to prevent any biting on the wires. 

One suggestion for modification: the Omnetics nano connector can come loose after several dozen turns if the cable tension is too high, so some way to provide more support to the connection off the end of this commutator would save some trouble for ensuring the cable stays connected at that particular junction. Otherwise it works great for our purposes!
